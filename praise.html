                        of 2019 I started coursework at DMACC to complete my AAS CIS degree with a focus in programming
                        languages.</p>

                                <p>This is my personal recommendation for Anthony Hamlin. I was executive director of
                                    the Iowa Agriculture Innovation Center and directly supervised Anthony’s work at the
                                    Center for the last two years. Since the Center is closing, I wanted to ensure
                                    that you, as a potential employer for Anthony, would feel free to contact me at my
                                    new position regarding Anthony’s skills, knowledge and expertise.
                                    <br /><br /> First, let me say that I wish I could have taken Anthony with me to the
                                    Iowa Department of Economic Development. I would happily re-employ Anthony as I
                                    considered him to be a valuable member of the Center’s team, who consistently
                                    achieved
                                    excellent results and always delivered, exceeding expectations.
                                    <br /><br /> Anthony has been the Center’s Technology and Marketing Specialist and
                                    displayed a wide variety of skills and had in-depth expertise in all areas of the
                                    Center’s web presence including design and development, programming, and database
                                    development
                                    and integration into the website. Since the Center is closing down, the websites are
                                    discontinued but Anthony’s work was exceptional.
                                    <br /><br /> Anthony is extremely knowledgeable and is easy to work with. He is able
                                    to explain complex IT issues and regulations in lay terms and enjoyed excellent
                                    working relationships with his customers – both internal and external.
                                    <br /><br /> His design work was creative and innovative. He has a great sense of
                                    style, color and appropriateness. And is a dedicated worker who delivers quality
                                    results, every time.
                                    <br /><br /> I highly recommend Anthony for employment. He is a team player and a
                                    leader. He would be a great asset to any organization. I really enjoyed working with
                                    such a skilled professional.
                                    <br /><br /> Sincerely,</P>

                                <p>I wanted to take this opportunity to give my recommendation for Anthony Hamlin.
                                    Anthony was a valuable member of the Iowa Interactive staff in the year I was able
                                    to work with him.
                                    <br /><br /> The quality of Anthony's work was always excellent and I believe that
                                    he could be an asset to any company for which he worked. Anthony always completed
                                    tasks in a timely manner and the quality of his work was excellent. He worked hard
                                    and
                                    was able to give appropriate feedback and opinions when asked. He learned things
                                    which were out of his range of knowledge to assist the team in completing its work.
                                    <br /><br /> He took his position very seriously and did an excellent job on the
                                    projects given to him. One of Anthony's greatest qualities was his sense of humor.
                                    He was able to fit into the office easily and was a pleasure to work with in the
                                    year that
                                    I worked with him.
                                    <br /><br /> I am very hopeful that Anthony is successful in future endeavors and am
                                    very grateful for the work that he did while at Iowa Interactive.
                                    <br /><br /> Sincerely,

                                <p>Anthony Hamlin worked for Iowa Interactive, Inc., a sub-division of NIC, Inc., as a
                                    Web Designer/Developer. He reported directly to me, the Art Director.
                                    <br /><br /> Anthony was responsible for creating and maintaining highly interactive
                                    websites for government agencies of the State of Iowa. Sites were delegated to
                                    Anthony to produce from beginning to end. His layouts were innovative and made
                                    navigation
                                    for the public as easy as possible. Our goal at Iowa Interactive, Inc., was for the
                                    public to be able to use state government services from their home or office, saving
                                    time and making it more convenient for people who could not make it to State
                                    offices.
                                    <br /><br /> Anthony is very observant to what attracts people to a site. What they
                                    are going to be thinking while they are looking at a site, and anticipating what
                                    they will want to do next.
                                    <br /><br /> Anthony and I were constantly showing each other sites and techniques
                                    that we had found on the web which we thought were eye catching, innovative, or
                                    improved techniques that we could use to further utilize the web for our surfers.
                                    Our main
                                    priorities were decreasing upload times and visual acceptance. Anthony also has an
                                    understanding of Java Script, CSS, HTML and orther web based technologies. Along
                                    with his strong print background Anthony became a very valuable asset to our staff.
                                    <br /><br /> Our development team is in a small office and with small offices come
                                    close relationships. Anthony knew how to liven up the office with his humor. He got
                                    along great with everybody and was eager to help out in any way he could.<br />
