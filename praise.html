              I have 7+ years of experience in web development. In the past I
              created and translated ux/ui concepts and static designs into
              responsive and dynamically functional websites. In the Summer of
              2019 I started coursework at DMACC to complete my AAS CIS degree
              with a focus in programming languages and software engineering.

                  <p>
                    This is my personal recommendation for Anthony Hamlin. I was
                    executive director of the Iowa Agriculture Innovation Center
                    and directly supervised Anthony’s work at the Center for the
                    last two years. Since the Center is closing, I wanted to
                    ensure that you, as a potential employer for Anthony, would
                    feel free to contact me at my new position regarding
                    Anthony’s skills, knowledge and expertise. <br /><br />
                    First, let me say that I wish I could have taken Anthony
                    with me to the Iowa Department of Economic Development. I
                    would happily re-employ Anthony as I considered him to be a
                    valuable member of the Center’s team, who consistently
                    achieved excellent results and always delivered, exceeding
                    expectations. <br /><br />
                    Anthony has been the Center’s Technology and Marketing
                    Specialist and displayed a wide variety of skills and had
                    in-depth expertise in all areas of the Center’s web presence
                    including design and development, programming, and database
                    development and integration into the website. Since the
                    Center is closing down, the websites are discontinued but
                    Anthony’s work was exceptional. <br /><br />
                    Anthony is extremely knowledgeable and is easy to work with.
                    He is able to explain complex IT issues and regulations in
                    lay terms and enjoyed excellent working relationships with
                    his customers – both internal and external. <br /><br />
                    His design work was creative and innovative. He has a great
                    sense of style, color and appropriateness. And is a
                    dedicated worker who delivers quality results, every time.
                    <br /><br />
                    I highly recommend Anthony for employment. He is a team
                    player and a leader. He would be a great asset to any
                    organization. I really enjoyed working with such a skilled
                    professional. <br /><br />

                    I wanted to take this opportunity to give my recommendation
                    for Anthony Hamlin. Anthony was a valuable member of the
                    Iowa Interactive staff in the year I was able to work with
                    him. <br /><br />
                    The quality of Anthony's work was always excellent and I
                    believe that he could be an asset to any company for which
                    he worked. Anthony always completed tasks in a timely manner
                    and the quality of his work was excellent. He worked hard
                    and was able to give appropriate feedback and opinions when
                    asked. He learned things which were out of his range of
                    knowledge to assist the team in completing its work.
                    <br /><br />
                    He took his position very seriously and did an excellent job
                    on the projects given to him. One of Anthony's greatest
                    qualities was his sense of humor. He was able to fit into
                    the office easily and was a pleasure to work with in the
                    year that I worked with him. <br /><br />
                    I am very hopeful that Anthony is successful in future
                    endeavors and am very grateful for the work that he did
                    while at Iowa Interactive. <br /><br />

                    Anthony Hamlin worked for Iowa Interactive, Inc., a
                    sub-division of NIC, Inc., as a Web Designer/Developer. He
                    reported directly to me, the Art Director. <br /><br />
                    Anthony was responsible for creating and maintaining highly
                    interactive websites for government agencies of the State of
                    Iowa. Sites were delegated to Anthony to produce from
                    beginning to end. His layouts were innovative and made
                    navigation for the public as easy as possible. Our goal at
                    Iowa Interactive, Inc., was for the public to be able to use
                    state government services from their home or office, saving
                    time and making it more convenient for people who could not
                    make it to State offices. <br /><br />
                    Anthony is very observant to what attracts people to a site.
                    What they are going to be thinking while they are looking at
                    a site, and anticipating what they will want to do next.
                    <br /><br />
                    Anthony and I were constantly showing each other sites and
                    techniques that we had found on the web which we thought
                    were eye catching, innovative, or improved techniques that
                    we could use to further utilize the web for our surfers. Our
                    main priorities were decreasing upload times and visual
                    acceptance. Anthony also has an understanding of Java
                    Script, CSS, HTML and orther web based technologies. Along
                    with his strong print background Anthony became a very
                    valuable asset to our staff. <br /><br />
                    Our development team is in a small office and with small
                    offices come close relationships. Anthony knew how to liven
                    up the office with his humor. He got along great with
                    everybody and was eager to help out in any way he could.<br />
